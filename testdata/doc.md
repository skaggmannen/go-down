## Introduction

Please allow me to introduce myself; I'm a man of wealth and taste.

## Problem description

I have some very important messages for you today. First of all
I would like to renounce all these rumours about me being a lizard; it _not_ true!

### The blame game

The people responsible for spreading these lies are the following:

1. The Pope.
2. The Queen of England.
3. My neighbor Keith, who also never returned that VHS of Bloodsports with
   Jean Claude van Damme that he borrowed back in August of '97. It was very
   precious to me, Keith, and I'd like it back post haste.
   
   If you're somehow unable to fulfill my request, consider these options:
   
   * Eat shit.
   * Go to hell.
   * Give me back my Bloodsports.
   
4. My cat.
5. This stuff:
   
   ```go
   package main
   
   import fmt
   
   func main() {
   	fmt.Println("Hello world!")
   }
   ```

7. Consider Phlebas:

   > - That guy from Village People

That's all folks, have a good night.

```go

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
